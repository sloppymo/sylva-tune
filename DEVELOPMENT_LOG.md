# EmpathyFine Development Log

## Project Overview
EmpathyFine is a state-of-the-art GUI application for training empathy-focused language models with multi-framework support (Hugging Face, OpenAI), advanced evaluation metrics, and bias mitigation tools.

## Development Timeline

### 2024-01-09: Project Inception and Phase 1 Implementation

#### Initial Setup (v0.1.0)
- **Project Structure Created**
  - Established modular architecture with `src/` directory
  - Created core modules: `core/`, `gui/`, `training/`, `evaluation/`
  - Set up proper Python package structure with `__init__.py` files

- **Core Components Implemented**
  1. **Project Manager** (`src/core/project_manager.py`)
     - SQLite-based project persistence
     - Project configuration with empathy-specific settings
     - Training history tracking
     - Dataset management integration

  2. **Main Window** (`src/gui/main_window.py`)
     - PyQt6 application framework
     - Draggable panels with QSplitter
     - Multi-tab interface
     - Theme support
     - Project tree explorer
     - Status bar with GPU detection

  3. **Conversation Simulator** (`src/gui/panels/conversation_simulator.py`)
     - Real-time chat interface
     - Emotion control (7 emotions + intensity)
     - Mock empathy scoring
     - Response analysis panel
     - Conversation history management

  4. **Dataset Hub** (`src/gui/panels/dataset_hub.py`)
     - JSONL/CSV import functionality
     - Dataset validation for empathy requirements
     - Example editor with navigation
     - Emotion tagging system
     - Augmentation preview (placeholder)
     - Multi-threaded loading with progress tracking

  5. **Training Panel** (`src/gui/panels/training_panel.py`)
     - LoRA configuration interface
     - Training parameter controls
     - Empathy-specific settings
     - Live monitoring dashboard
     - Training history tracking
     - Mock training worker thread

  6. **Dialog System**
     - Project Wizard for new projects
     - Project Selector for opening projects
     - Preferences Dialog with tabbed settings
     - Dataset Validator (placeholder)
     - Bias Scanner (placeholder)

  7. **Theme Manager** (`src/gui/utils/theme_manager.py`)
     - Light theme (default PyQt)
     - Dark theme with custom stylesheet
     - Blue theme with modern colors
     - Custom theme support

#### Technical Decisions
- **PyQt6**: Chosen for modern UI capabilities and cross-platform support
- **SQLite**: Lightweight database for project persistence
- **Modular Architecture**: Enables easy extension and maintenance
- **Thread Workers**: For non-blocking UI during long operations

#### Current Limitations
- Model training is mocked (not connected to actual ML frameworks)
- Empathy scoring uses simple keyword matching
- Evaluation metrics are placeholders
- Export functionality not implemented

## Architecture Notes

### Design Patterns Used
1. **MVC Pattern**: Clear separation between data (models), UI (views), and logic (controllers)
2. **Observer Pattern**: PyQt signals/slots for component communication
3. **Factory Pattern**: Project creation and configuration
4. **Worker Thread Pattern**: Background operations without UI blocking

### Module Responsibilities
- `core/`: Business logic and data management
- `gui/panels/`: Individual UI components
- `gui/dialogs/`: Modal dialog windows
- `gui/utils/`: UI utilities and helpers
- `training/`: (Future) Actual model training logic
- `evaluation/`: (Future) Empathy evaluation algorithms

## Future Development Plans

### Phase 2 (Next Steps)
1. **Model Integration**
   - Connect Hugging Face Transformers
   - Implement actual LoRA training
   - Add OpenAI fine-tuning API support

2. **Empathy Evaluation**
   - Develop neural empathy classifier
   - Implement multi-dimensional empathy scoring
   - Create bias detection algorithms

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Real-time training curves with matplotlib
   - Model comparison tools
   - A/B testing framework

### Phase 3 (Long-term)
1. **Deployment Tools**
   - Docker containerization
   - Model export to various formats
   - API endpoint generation

2. **Collaboration**
   - Multi-user project support
   - Version control integration
   - Cloud storage options

## Dependencies and Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- PyQt6 for GUI
- pandas/numpy for data processing
- jsonlines for dataset handling
- SQLite (built-in) for persistence
- Future: transformers, torch, peft for ML

## Known Issues
1. Application crashes if trying to open project without any existing projects
2. Mock responses in conversation simulator are limited
3. Dataset validation is placeholder only
4. No actual model training occurs yet

## Testing Notes
- Manual testing performed on Ubuntu Linux
- PyQt6 import verified
- Basic UI navigation tested
- Project creation/loading workflow validated

## Performance Considerations
- Dataset loading uses worker threads to prevent UI freezing
- SQLite queries are kept simple for speed
- UI updates are batched where possible

## Security Considerations
- API keys should be stored in .env files (not implemented yet)
- Project files are not encrypted (future enhancement)
- No user authentication (single-user application)
